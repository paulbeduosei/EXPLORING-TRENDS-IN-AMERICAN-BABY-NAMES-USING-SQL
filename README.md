# EXPLORING-TRENDS-IN-AMERICAN-BABY-NAMES-USING-SQL
Just wrapped up a really fun SQL analysis exploring how American baby name trends have evolved over the last century — from 1920 to 2020!

Using Social Security Administration data, I analyzed which names stayed popular for over 100 years, which ones faded, and how the top names of today compare to those of earlier generations.

This project was a great reminder of how SQL can uncover long-term cultural and demographic trends — and how data can tell powerful stories about changing tastes, identity, and society.

This SQL project analyzes 101 years of American baby name data from the U.S. Social Security Administration, covering 1920–2020.

Using filtering, grouping, aggregation, and ranking queries, I identified long-standing popular names, emerging modern favorites, and decade-by-decade shifts in naming trends.

The project demonstrates skills in time-series analysis, categorical comparisons, and working with large datasets to understand cultural trends.
